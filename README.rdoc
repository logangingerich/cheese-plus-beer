Cheese + Beer is a simple Ruby on Rails Web Application for searching, pairing and cataloging your favorite cheeses and beers. Users can search beer or cheese styles and find associated pairings. Every user can upvote or downvote pairings that they like or dislike, as well as save their favorite pairings to their personal profile, where they can take notes on said pairing.

Enjoy!
